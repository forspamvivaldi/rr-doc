# 🎛️ Simulation parameters

In the **Simulation parameters** tab, only the special set of the parameters is available which is valid only for ring rolling simulation. It is possible to control the mesh adaptation and additional adjusting of simulation by this set of parameters. By default, the most optimal parameters are used. We recommend changing these parameters in very rare cases.
