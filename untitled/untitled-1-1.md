# Geometry requirements

* All instruments should have axis of rotation
* Guide rolls should have **2 axis** of rotation:

  1. own axis of rotation
  2. axis of rotation for the first axis

  > order of axis is important

* Axis of the main roll, mandrel and guide rolls should be parallel to the axis Z
* Axis of the main roll should cross the center of the coordinate system \( $$x = 0, y=0$$\)
* There is no need to specify an axis for the workpiece because it is rotating due to contact with the main roll and the mandrel
