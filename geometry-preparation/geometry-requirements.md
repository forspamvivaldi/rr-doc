# ‚ùó Geometry requirements

* All instruments should have an axis of rotation
* Guide rolls should have **2 axes** of rotation:
  1. own axis of rotation
  2. and axis of rotation for the first axis

![Schema of 2 axes of guide rolls](../.gitbook/assets/guide-roolls-axes-2.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
order of axis is important
{% endhint %}

* Axis of the main roll, mandrel, and guide rolls should be parallel to the Z-axis
* Axis of the main roll should cross the center of the coordinate system \( $$x = 0, y=0$$\)
* The horizontal movement of the mandrel is carried out strictly against the X-axis
* There is no need to specify an axis for the workpiece because it is rotating due to contact with the main roll and the mandrel
